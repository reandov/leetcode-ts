/**
 * Course Schedule II
 *
 * Returns an ordering of courses that satisfies all prerequisites, or an empty
 * array when no valid ordering exists.
 *
 * Builds a directed graph from each prerequisite to the courses it unlocks,
 * then uses Kahn's topological sort. Courses with no remaining prerequisites
 * are processed first, reducing the indegree of dependent courses until either
 * every course is scheduled or a cycle prevents progress.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is numCourses and E is the number of
 * prerequisites.
 * Space complexity: O(V + E).
