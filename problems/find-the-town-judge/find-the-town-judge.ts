/**
 * Find the Town Judge
 *
 * Return the town judge's label when exactly one person trusts nobody and is
 * trusted by every other person; otherwise return -1.
 *
 * Approach: Count how many people trust each label and how many people each
 * label trusts. The judge, if present, is the only label with n - 1 incoming
 * trusts and zero outgoing trusts.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n + t), where t is trust.length.
 * Space complexity: O(n).
