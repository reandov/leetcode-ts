/*
 * ISOMORPHIC STRINGS
 *
 * Description: Two strings are isomorphic when every character in the first
 * string can be replaced to produce the second string. A character must always
 * map to the same character, and two different characters cannot map to the
 * same character.
 *
 * E.g.: s = "egg" and t = "add" returns true because "e" maps to "a" and
 * "g" maps to "d".
 *
 * Solution: We keep one map from characters in s to characters in t and a
 * second map in the opposite direction. For every pair, both existing mappings
 * must agree. This guarantees a one-to-one relationship between characters.
