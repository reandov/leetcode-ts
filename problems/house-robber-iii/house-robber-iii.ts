/**
 * House Robber III
 *
 * Returns the maximum amount that can be robbed from a binary tree of houses
 * without robbing two directly linked houses on the same night.
 *
 * Approach: Use depth-first dynamic programming. For each node, compute the
 * best total when robbing that node and when skipping it, then combine those
 * choices bottom-up.
 * Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * Space complexity: O(h), where h is the tree height from the recursion stack.
