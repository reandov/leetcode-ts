 * PATH SUM
 *
 * Determines whether the tree contains a root-to-leaf path whose node values
 * add up to `targetSum`.
 *
 * Uses depth-first search while carrying the sum of the current path. At each
 * leaf, the accumulated sum is compared with the target. Each recursive call
 * receives its own numeric sum, so values from one branch cannot affect another.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes.
 * Space complexity: O(h) for the recursion stack, where h is the tree height.
