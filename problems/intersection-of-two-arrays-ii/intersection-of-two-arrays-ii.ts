/*
 * INTERSECTION OF TWO ARRAYS II
 *
 * Description: In this problem we need to return the values that appear in both
 * arrays, including repeated values when they are available in both inputs. The
 * result can be returned in any order.
 *
 * E.g.: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1] and nums2 = [2, 2] returns [2, 2].
 *
 * Solution: We can use a Hash Map to count how many times each number appears
 * in the first array. Then we iterate over the second array and, when a number
 * still has an available count, we add it to the result and decrease its count.
 * When the count reaches 0 we remove it from the map, so each number is used no
 * more times than it appears in both arrays.
